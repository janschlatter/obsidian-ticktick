# Obsidian TickTick

[TickTick](https://ticktick.com/home) integration for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

**Note:** This plugin is still in early alpha and is subject to change at any time!

Currently, this plugin works with [TickTick for Mac](https://ticktick.com/about/mac) since it depends on [iOS-URL-Scheme](https://support.ticktick.com/hc/en-us/articles/360007930051-TickTick-iOS-URL-Scheme)
